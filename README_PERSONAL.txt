Hey this Sanskar 

I have made a basic songplayer app using react js as my javascript framework

This is a recording of the website of how it looks on my laptop in case due to some issue you get an issue in viewing my website:

also to start the app before doing that create a new terminal and type:

npx json-server --watch data/songs.json --port 7000 

this is to fetch data from the json file and then in the original terminal type npm run start 

npm run start

this runs the app
